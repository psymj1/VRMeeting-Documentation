        <hr>
        <h2>NOTE: The Host Server is written in Java</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Step 1: Install Java</h3>
        <p>In order to run the VRMeeting Host Server you'll need to first install Java version <b>1.8.0_111</b> or later.</p>
        <p>You can check your Java version using the command: <code>java -version</code></p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Step 2: Obtaining the Host Server files</h3>
        <p>If you haven't already then you'll need to pull down the latest distribution version of VRMeeting from <a href="https://github.com/psymj1/VRMeeting-Distributions">The Distribution Repository</a>, This contains the files for the Host Server</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Step 3: Configuring the properties file</h3>
        <p>In order to use the Host Server you'll need to set the port it will listen on and configure it to be able to communicate with the <a href="installweb.html">Web Server</a> for user authentication</p>
        <p>Navigate to the <i>/VRMeeting-Host-Server</i> folder in the distribution you've downloaded and you should find a file called <code>properties.txt</code></p>
        <p>Inside of <code>properties.txt</code> you'll need to set the port the HostServer will listen on by changing the value of the <b>ListenOnPort</b> property.</p>
        <p>You'll also need to set the property <b>WebServerURL</b> to the URL of the <a href="installweb.html">Web Server</a>. This is usually in the form of an IP Address and Port Number combination: <code>ipaddress:port</code> or a domain name</p>
        <h3>If you don't have a <code>properties.txt</code> file</h3>
        <p>If there is not a file called <code>properties.txt</code> in the directory <i>/VRMeeting-Host-Server</i> then you'll need to replace it.</p>
        <p>You can download the <a href="../files/properties.txt">Default Host Server Properties File</a> by right-clicking on the link and clicking <i>Save Link As...</i> and putting this file in the same folder as the <code>VRMeeting-Host-Server.jar</code></p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Step 4: Configuring Firewalls</h3>
        <p>You'll need to make sure that the machine the Host-Server allows TCP connections on the port you've configured it to in the <code>properties.txt</code> file in the previous step</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Step 5: Running the Server</h3>
        <p>To run the server you need to be in the <i>/VRMeeting-Host-Server</i> directory and execute the following command: <code>java -Xmx2048M -Xms2048M -jar vrmeeting-host-server.jar </code></p>
        <p>When you first go to run the server you'll find you'll be prompted to agree to a disclaimer that the project is not suitable for production environments:</p>
        <img src="../images/warning.png">
        <p>In order to use the server you must agree to this disclaimer by typing the word '<code>agree</code>' into the console and press enter:</p>     
        <img src="../images/warningagree.PNG">
        <hr>
        <h4>Note: Error in first run</h4>
        <p>If you encounter the following error when you attempt to run the Host-Server for the first time:</p>
        <img src="../images/failconnect.PNG">
        <p>It means the Host-Server could not connect to the Web Server. If this is the case then you'll need to check you entered the correct URL for the Web Server in <b>Step 3</b></p>
        <p>If you still receive this error then you'll need to make sure the Web Server has been properly installed using the <a href="installweb.html">Installation Guide</a></p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Step 6: Finishing the Web Server Installation</h3>
        <p>In order for the Web Server to be complete, it needs to know the location of the Host Server.</p>
        <p>As such, you'll need to make a note of the IP Address or name, and port for the machine that the Host Server is running on and then refer to the <a href="installweb.html">Web Server Installation Guide</a> <b>Step 10</b> to know what to do with them</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Step : Finished!</h3>
        <p>The installation should now be complete.</p>

        <hr>
        <h2>Common Problems when attempting to run the jar</h2>
        <h3>Listening port already in use</h3>
        <p>If you see the following output then you'll need to change the port that you're passing into the runtime arguments as the port is already being used by another program.</p>
        <p>If you've previously used the VRMeeting_Host_Server on the same port then you'll want to double check that you haven't left it running by accident.</p><br>
