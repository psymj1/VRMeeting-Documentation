        <ul>
            <li>The audio transmission can become very delayed and choppy</li>
            <li>Slide changes can be fast on participants but slow on the presenter meaning the presenter does not see changes in presentation quickly</li>
            <li>Sometimes when creating an account the server can be too slow to finish the request and so the client treats this as a timed out request. The account is usually actually created seconds later and can then be logged into</li>
            <li>Clients can be slow to detect that they have lost connection to the server</li>
            <li>Client does not wait until meeting files have been uploaded to the server</li>
        </ul>
