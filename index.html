        <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>VRMeeting is an Android VR experience with aim of allowing a presenter to host a meeting in which many participants will be able to listen in to what the presenter has to say.<br>
                The presenter has the opportunity to upload a PDf presentation which they can then navigate through which will also be displayed to the participants.<br>
                The project was sponsored by IBM and has been developed by the developers of Team Hexcore from the University of Nottingham
